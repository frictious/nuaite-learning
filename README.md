# nuaite-learning
An E-Learning portal built for Njala University Association of IT Students, as a final year project
I developed it as a means of improving myself for David and Tamba.

The project has both front-end for the end users/students, and back-end for admin.

A single login system seperated by a "role" property was used as a means of identifying an admin, and or student.

The system allows the admin to add department(s), program(s), course(s)/module(s), curriculum(s), timetable(s), note(s), past exam questions/quizes, course info,
and assignment(s) plus instructions for the assignment as well.

It also allows students grade(s) to be entered into the system for the students to access and be able to know their current standing and gpa for that academic year
